## Welcome! It's fantastic to have you here! :raised_hands:
--------------------------------------------------------

We are excited to share the code for our [interactive data story](https://ipyvizzu-story-world-population.streamlit.app/) in Streamlit, created with ipyvizzu. This app was the example used in a tutorial [blog post](https://blog.streamlit.io/create-an-animated-data-story-with-ipyvizzu-and-streamlit/) that provides insight into how the technology behind it works.

You can find the final app in the app.py file. Additionally, we have provided the slim and simple versions used in the blog post in case you are interested. The notebooks in the notebook folder were used to create the data stories and GIFs embedded in the blog post. The embedded stories themselves can be found in the html folder, and the source data is located in the Data folder.

We hope this code serves as inspiration for you to build more interactive, animated data stories! For further resources, we recommend checking out the [ipyvizzu documentation](https://ipyvizzu.vizzuhq.com/latest/) and the [ipyvizzu-story documentation](https://ipyvizzu-story.vizzuhq.com/latest/).

If you are interested in contributing to the project, please feel free to visit the [ipyvizzu repo](https://github.com/vizzuhq/ipyvizzu) and the [ipyvizzu-story repo](https://github.com/vizzuhq/ipyvizzu-story). Don't forget to give us a :star2: if you find the code helpful!

Lastly, we would like to invite you to check out some of the [data stories](https://www.reddit.com/user/vizzuhq/?sort=top) we have built and shared with the public at. 

Thank you for stopping by!
